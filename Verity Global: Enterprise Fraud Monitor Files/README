Verity Global: Enterprise Fraud Monitor
Real-Time Global Security Intelligence Dashboard
Verity Global is a high-performance, real-time visualization suite designed to provide security stakeholders with an "at-a-glance" view of global transaction health. By simulating live merchant traffic across five continents, the platform demonstrates the capability to distinguish between standard consumer behavior and high-risk anomalies.

Stakeholder Value Proposition
This dashboard serves as a central nervous system for security operations, offering three core pillars of value:
1.	Operational Awareness: Real-time monitoring of transaction throughput (Verified vs. Blocked) ensures that legitimate commerce flows uninterrupted while threats are neutralized.
2.	Geospatial Intelligence: Identifying "Hot Zones" allows the enterprise to adjust security protocols or authentication requirements based on regional risk spikes.
3.	Industry-Specific Defense: By categorizing attacks (e.g., Crypto, Luxury, Banking), the system allows for the deployment of industry-specific countermeasures.

System Architecture & Components
1. Live Security Health (Sidebar)
•	Metric: A dynamic comparison of Verified (Safe) vs. Blocked (Fraudulent) transactions.
•	Business Logic: Demonstrates the system's "Precision-over-Paranoia" approach, ensuring the vast majority of safe users enjoy a frictionless experience.
2. Global Risk Map (Center)
•	Visual: A live geo-spatial plot of the last 30 network events.
•	Business Logic: Provides an immediate visual audit of where the brand's digital footprint is most active and where defensive resources are currently deployed.
3. Regional & Industry Analytics (Sidebar)
•	Regional Risk: A bar chart identifying which global hubs (NA, EU, AS, etc.) are currently experiencing the highest volumes of intercepted fraud.
•	Industry Attack Surface: A distribution analysis (Pie Chart) showing which sectors are being targeted by bad actors in the current session.
4. Global Event Log (Bottom)
•	Details: A transparent, high-fidelity ledger of the most recent transactions, including Time, Merchant Identity, Amount, and Location.

Technical Implementation (For Developers)
•	Framework: Built on Streamlit for high-speed, reactive UI updates.
•	Data Engine: Uses Pandas for real-time aggregation and NumPy for statistical traffic simulation.
•	Visualization: Powered by Plotly Express, utilizing custom color mapping (#00CC96 for Verified, #EF553B for Blocked) to ensure zero-ambiguity reporting.
•	Logic: Implements a dynamic "Traffic Burst" engine that simulates 1–5 concurrent transactions per refresh cycle to mimic actual enterprise load.

How to Run the Project
1.	Ensure you have Python installed.
2.	Install the required libraries:
Bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
3.	Run the application:
Bash
streamlit run your_filename.py

Confidentiality Note: This dashboard is a conceptual prototype for Verity Global. The data shown is simulated for demonstration purposes to showcase the platform's architectural robustness and visualization capabilities.
